### Overview

2. Created prefabs for level designers to build their levels.
3. Created the UI with native Unity UI system, having features such as level select, win/lose window, settings menu, tutorial pop-up, dialouge window, and embedded videos
4. Bug fixing rapidly whild building new features within 135 hours of development
5. Integrating Unity to android platform, avoid and solve risks of performance issues
