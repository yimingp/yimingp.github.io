Vaporum, designed in my C++ game engine, mirrors the 3D format of Military Madness. This game initiates with players positioned at opposite sides of the map, equipped with a set number of tanks. They navigate a hexagonal map in a turn-based manner, aiming to defeat the opposing team. The game features five unique tank varieties, each with distinct attributes and skills. Vaporum offers both shared screen and LAN connectivity options for gameplay.
